## Adding new features

- Please open a pull request for your code change, no matter how small the change. As irritating as that is, someone should be around to commit it at almost all hours of the day, so you shouldn't be delayed that long.
- Please keep the master branch deployable at all times. New features in branches. Bugfixes in branches.
- Rebase where possible--don't merge.
- Name your branches descriptively, and delete them when they're merged in.

### Documentation

All code should be thoroughly documented using Markdown with YARD tags. You can run the YARD server and have it reload while you work so you can preview your changes:

```shell
yard server --reload
```

Then tune in to `locahost:8808` to see what's going on.

Don’t get discouraged! We estimate that the response time from the
maintainers is around: NaN
